Learning algorithms from text and static images is quite boring. For that, there have been many great websites that view animations of various algorithms. However, for us being coders, nothing can be more comprehensible than visualizing the actual working code. So here we introduce Algorithm Visualizer.

## Contributing

**I want to add or improve an algorithm.**

- We have a separate repository for public algorithms. Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in [`algorithms`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) repo.

**I want to improve the UI.**

- Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo. The [directory structure](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md#algorithm-visualizer) might be helpful as well.

**I want to enhance visualization libraries.**

- It is highly recommended to read the entire [project details](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md) before working on it. Changes in visualization libraries often require quite a lot of work since you may need to work on all of 3 repositories: [`algorithms`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms), [`tracers`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers), [`algorithm-visualizer`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer).

**I have a question in regards to contributing.**

- Raising an issue is another way of contributing!
